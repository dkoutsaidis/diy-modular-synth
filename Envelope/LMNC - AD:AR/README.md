# AD/AR Envelope - Look Mum No Computer
A simple Attack-Decay/Attack-Release envelope module ([link](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/projects#/simple-envelope-generator)).

### Pros
- Very simple design
- Fast attack

### Cons
- The Attack-Decay mode works best with trigger signals. The attack is not actually variable in this mode.
- The Attack-Release mode works best with gate signals.
- Requires at least 10Vp-p gate/trigger signals (positive-only).

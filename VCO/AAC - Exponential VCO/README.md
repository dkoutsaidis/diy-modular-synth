# VCO - All About Circuits
A very simple and intuitive VCO module ([link](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/diy-synth-series-vco/)). Schematics available soon.

### Pros
- very simple design
- very intuitive - good for understanding the core oscillator's functionallity, as well as the linear to exponential converter
- sounds OK

### Cons
- VCC/VDD needs some tunning
- is not very easy to tune the linear to exponential converter

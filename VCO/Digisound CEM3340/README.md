# VCO/LFO - Digisound Project 80 - CEM3340
A great sounding VCO/LFO module, part of the [Digisound Project 80 series](http://www.digisound80.co.uk/digisound/modules/modules.htm). All the schematics and PCBs can be found [here](http://www.digisound80.co.uk/digisound/modules/80-2.htm). The `CEM4430` chip was the brain to a lot of [legendary synths](https://electricdruid.net/cem3340-vco-voltage-controlled-oscillator-designs/)!

### Pros
- great sound
- full-featured VCO module
- operates in an LFO mode
- it can be tunned fairly easily

### Cons
- the design is very old and thus the PCB & Panel are huge
- very outdated and hard to find electronic components
- the original design in not for eurorack format and thus it power supply and panel specs need some modifications

# VCO/LFO - Nuts & Volts - CEM3340
Originally featured by the Nuts & Volts magazine and later published by [Division 6](https://division-6.com/products/cem3340-vco/). It is actually the same VCO circuit, with the same chip but in a more modern design that the original [Digisound Project 80](../Digisound%20CEM3340).

### Pros
- great sound
- full-featured VCO module
- can operate in an non-audio rate as an LFO
- it can be tunned very easily

### Cons
